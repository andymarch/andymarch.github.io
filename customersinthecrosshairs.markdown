# Abstract
As users now expect more from the organisations they interact with online
managing the identity of your customers is becoming much more complex. Password
dumps, multiple devices and poor MFA adoption put pressure on security and
development teams. All the time your competition is waiting in the wings to
offer an alternative if your offering doesn't meet the customer's expectations.
