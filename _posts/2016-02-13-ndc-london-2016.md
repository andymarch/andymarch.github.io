Once again in January I headed to the Excel centre in London to attend NDC. NDC (the conference formally known as Norweign Developers Conference) has been my conference of choice for the last few years, I feel it provides a great mix of technical and soft skills sessions, great networking and the best conference food going.

The conference organisers go to the fantastic effort of recording every presentation and making these freely available on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/channels/1027318). So below is my list of attended sessions and the links to the recordings, I'll try to update these as the videos come up. In my list below are a few sessions I missed in person but heard good things about or spotted on the talk rating board (yes, there is a board in the vendor hall showing the best rated talks).
