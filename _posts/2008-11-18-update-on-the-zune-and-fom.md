Just a quick update on what was mentioned by [Dom](http://andymarch.co.uk/?p=47#comment-8 "Dom's post") in the comments of my previous post, I've just tried the region switch and still can't access 'the social' elements of the Zune. It is asking for a confirmation of terms and conditions on the Zune website which appears to be doing an ip look up for my location. This might work once I've got an activated account, looks like i'm still going to need a poxy to do this. Thanks for your comment Dom and I'll give this another try once I've proxied an account.

Future of Mobile was awesome yesturday Chris and myself had a great time, I have a ton of notes of sift through now. I hope to get a post up by the end of the week.
