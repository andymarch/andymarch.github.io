For the last month or so I have been playing with WordPress themes and bootstrap with the intent of finally replacing the slightly tweaked standard theme that I've been running for the last four years or so. It's finally at a point where I am happy to leave it up permanently, there is definitely a couple of bits I need to tweak but as a whole I'm happy with how it has turned out. Bootstrap made working with dynamic re-sizing an absolute breeze, go on scale it up and down a couple of times.

The image above is just a part of one my favorite photographs. I took this at [Reculver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reculver "Reculver") in Kent at sunset with my Sony NEX5. On the to-do list is a better photo plug-in so I can post a few more of these photos until I get that sorted here is a link to the full image.

If you fancy having a look around the theme code it's all on [GitHub](https://github.com/andymarch/wp-harness "WP-Harness on GitHub").
