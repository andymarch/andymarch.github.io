Chris has written an interesting introduction to our final year group project on his [blog](http://blog.chrisnolan.me.uk/?p=36#more-36).  Our project has been an to implement a working secure peer-to-peer file system over the internet with anonymity as the key. I can honestly say it's without a doubt one of the most enjoyable projects I have worked on in a long time.  The core of my work has focused around the development of the Windows GUI and I'm working on a post about this, until then I highly recommend giving Chris' introduction a read.
