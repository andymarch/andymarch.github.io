One of my goals this year is to read one book at week throughout the year. Last year I missed this goal by about 6 books. As part of my study for each I'll be putting together a post with some of my favourite snippets from the book.

This book has been sat on my shelf for six months so I decided to kick start the year with clearing that pile of shame. Quite a different read to my usual choice by some good highlights all the same.

> If time remains unused, winter becomes a curse. Yet there is work to do, work to be done with the hands. Once this work begins, the clock no longer measures the passage of time.

> People often judge the level of a civilisation by the amount of paper it uses. That, however, is simply a matter of volume, not quality. Quality is how the heart and soul of a civilisation should be measured.

> The litmus test of a country's cultural level should be the lives led by ordinary people
