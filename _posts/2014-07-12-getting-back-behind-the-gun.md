The other weekend a few old friends invited me down to our local paintball field, [Campaign](http://campaign-paintball.com/ "Campaign"), to spend the day training with them. It was awesome to see the guys again and play some nice relaxed paintball. The new field Tony and his guys have built is truly impressive. For a few points we strapped the GoPro on to see how well it worked strapped to the barrel, other than showing just how much I need to practice the footage came out quite well.
