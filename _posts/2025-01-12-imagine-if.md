This was recommended to me by my wife as 'its just a taste of his longer works'. I will absolutely be picking up more from Ken Robinson this year.

> It is because of our ability to imagine that we don't live in the world as other creatures do, we create the worlds in which we live.

> You could be imaginative all day without doing anything about it, and as such, nothing would ever change. To make use of our imagination we need to take them one step further: we need to be creative 

> Imagination allows use to envision alternative possibilities, and creativity equips us with the tools to bring them into existence.

> The only times our lives look the sequential and intentional is when we sit down to write our resumes, at which point we do our best to hide the total chaos we've been living through in order to make it seem like we've been following an elaborate life plan.

> The line between fact and fiction, between trustworthy sources and propaganda masked as click bait, is fading. Finding the truth in a sea of deception is becoming an increasingly difficult daily task, and one we must help our young people master. Critical thinking should be at the heart of every discipline in school.

> Too often young people learn in groups but no *as* groups.

> We have no control over our birth - who we are born to, which genetic cocktail we inherit, and where we are born. Who we *become* is shaped by the crosscurrents of our personalities and the circumstances in which we live.

> Whenever you see the dates of someone's life the most important part is the dash in the middle. What did they do between birth and death?

> The features are aptitude and passion, the conditions are attitude and opportunity. Often the process goes something like: I get it; I love it; I want it; where is it?

> When we talk about saving the planet, we really mean saving our own life upon it.
