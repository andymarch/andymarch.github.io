Well it's finally up! I've been playing with the idea of relaunching this site for a long time now. As I've had a bit of down time before going into my final year I've decided to get myself in gear and do something constructive. This site will mostly be used to work on little side projects I've been developing, also I'm sure I'll end up posting updates on other things that occupy my time.Â  If you want to find out a bit more about me hit the about link.
