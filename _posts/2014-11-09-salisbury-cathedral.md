Went down to Somerset for a short break last weekend, on the way back we stopped in at Salisbury as we seem to be rapidly working our way round the cathedrals of England (this was the second of the weekend).

Caught a nice bit of setting winter sun through the branches of this tree in the cloisters, I wasn't thrilled with the shot when I took it but have managed to clean it up quite a bit with Lightroom to the point I think its one of my favourite recent photographs.
