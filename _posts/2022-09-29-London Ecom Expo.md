As part of my ongoing work with the Okta events team I shot down to London to present Customers in the Crosshairs at the eCommerce Expo. While I was only there briefly it was a very different event to our normal security focused shows and we had some really good conversations after my talk.

**Presenting:** [Customers in the Crosshairs](https://speakerdeck.com/andymarch/customers-in-the-crosshairs)

**Abstract**: As users now expect more from the organisations they interact with online managing the identity of your customers is becoming much more complex. Password dumps, multiple devices and poor MFA adoption put pressure on security and development teams. All the time your competition is waiting in the wings to offer an alternative if your offering doesn't meet the customer's expectations.
