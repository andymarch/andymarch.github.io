Presenting: [OAuth by Example Workshop](https://speakerdeck.com/andymarch/oauth-by-example-workshop)

Abstract: Authentication and authorization has come a long way in the last ten years. Are you still rolling your own identity? Don't know the differences between the authorization code grant from and the client credentials grant? Do you want to accept social authentication to your service but you're not sure how?

Join Andy March as we review OAuth and OIDC, their history, the problems they solve and how you can apply them to your services. This workshop will guide you through configuring Okta as an identity provider, deploying a simple web app enforcing authentication and authorization.
