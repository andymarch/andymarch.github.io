**Presenting:** [Identity as Code](https://speakerdeck.com/andymarch/identity-as-code)

**Abstract**: Users now have more complex identities than ever before; federated accounts, second-factor authentication, and multiple devices all these conditions need to be tested, but how? This talk will examine the minefield of identity and authentication in your pipeline and how your team can traverse this to ensure that you are testing all the conditions without resorting to manual steps.
