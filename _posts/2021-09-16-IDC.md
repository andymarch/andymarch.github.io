**Presenting:** [Customers in the Crosshairs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkzOp7D69LQ&list=PLIid085fSVduHYQWZhm5vqcIK9m_BYYZ3)

**Abstract**: As users now expect more from the organisations they interact with online managing the identity of your customers is becoming much more complex. Password dumps, multiple devices and poor MFA adoption put pressure on security and development teams. All the time your competition is waiting in the wings to offer an alternative if your offering doesn't meet the customer's expectations.

Join Andy in a session where he discusses the threats to your customers, the impact those threats can have on your organisation and how to build a customer identity which not only protects your customers but provides a better user experience.
