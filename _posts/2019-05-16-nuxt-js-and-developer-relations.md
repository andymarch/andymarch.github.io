I'm proud to say my first article was recently published over at developer.okta.com guiding you through the process of creating a universal javascript applications with Nuxt.js.

You can check out the full article [here](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/04/26/tutorial-build-universal-apps-with-nuxt).

While I've written technical material here in the past its been largely to get it out of my own head. So it was really interesting to be guided through the editing and review process by Okta's awesome devrel team.
