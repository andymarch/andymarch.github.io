...well damn its been a while since I've written a post on here. But life has been more than a little hectic over the last few months, exams, moving house, graduation and starting a new job.

Well four years after I started there I have graduated from the University of Kent with an upper second class bachelor of science with honors in Computer Science with a year in industry. It has without a doubt been an amazing four years, I've met some brilliant people, experienced so much and enjoyed myself immensely. I'd like to thank all of those who have been there over the last four years, early morning drives to practice, late night coding sessions, many awesome nights out and just kicking back to watch the world pass by. Without these people I would not have been able to achieve what I have.

I've been very fortunate that I've been able to secure myself a job, which I will not go into on here for many reasons. Its nice to be in a position to apply what I have learnt over the last four years, spend my working day with people who have an genuine interest in technology and most of all enjoy the work I do. After all what is a 40+ hour working week if you are only waiting for the other 128 hours?
