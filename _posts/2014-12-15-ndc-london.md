A couple of weeks back I got the opportunity to attend NDC London organised by the team between the Norwegian Developers Conference. They've branded this event to "new DevelopersConference() London" as Norwegian Developers Conference obviously limits their reach a little bit (to steal a joke from [@markrendle](https://twitter.com/markrendle)'s stand-up) . I went out to NDC Oslo last year to attend their dedicated security track and was really impressed by the quality of the event and the speakers they lined up so once the registration opened for their London event this year I knew I wanted to attend as much as I could.

Like any conference there are the fantastic talks and the ones where you wonder if you've walked into the wrong room. Probably my favourite talk from this years event was Coding Culture by Sven Peters, talking about what makes great engineering team and how to inject enthusiasm and passion into development. His slides and a recording of this talk are [here](http://svenpet.com/talks/coding-culture/), if you can only watch one this is it.

A few of the other highlights for me were:
