Yesterday saw a second defeat for the snoopers charter this time as a late set of amendments to a counter-terrorism bill. There is more detail from the EFF [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/britons-you-have-72-hours-stop-snoopers-charter) and the Open Rights Group [here](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/ourwork/reports/abuse-of-parliamentary-procedure). Yesterday's session served as a reminder that why due process and debate is needed; while we saw points from lords with little understand of what they were trying to legislate such as [Lord King](http://myparliament.info/Debates/Lords/2015-01-26/8238#contribution-332260) we also saw solid counter argument for balance from others such as [Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho](http://myparliament.info/Debates/Lords/2015-01-26/8238#contribution-333150).

While watching the back and forth on twitter during the debate the John Perry Barlow Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace crossed my mind. While the language is a little dated it's still very relevant to the issues being discussed.
