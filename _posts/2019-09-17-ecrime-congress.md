Presenting: [Customers in the Crosshairs](https://andymarch.co.uk/customersinthcrosshairs)

Abstract: As users now expect more from the organisations they interact with online managing the identity of your customers is becoming much more complex. Password dumps, multiple devices and poor MFA adoption put pressure on security and development teams. All the time your competition is waiting in the wings to offer an alternative if your offering doesn't meet the customer's expectations.
