title: "API Days Helsinki - Virtual Conference"
date: "2020-06-03"
---

A slightly different speaking experiance as the world tries to contiue during COVID. I swapped Helsinki for my home office to provide content for the first virtual API Days event. The on-site conference has been re-scheduleded for September (which sadly I can't attend). Prerecording the talk to an audience of one was odd but it did make it easier to respond to any questions in the chat during the talk.

**Presenting:** [Identity as Code](https://speakerdeck.com/andymarch/identity-as-code)

**Abstract**: Users now have more complex identities than ever before; federated accounts, second-factor authentication, and multiple devices all these conditions need to be tested, but how? This talk will examine the minefield of identity and authentication in your pipeline and how your team can traverse this to ensure that you are testing all the conditions without resorting to manual steps.
